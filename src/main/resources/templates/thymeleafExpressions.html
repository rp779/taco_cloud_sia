 The types of expressions Thymeleaf supports are:
${...} - Variable Expressions. These are the standard expressions.
*{...} - Selection Variable Expressions. These are the same as variable expressions, except that they are used in combination with a th:object attribute.
For example, if you have <form th:object="${form}">, then the expression *{field} resolves to ${form.field}. These are mostly used when using th:field attributes while creating a form.
#{...} - Message Expressions. These expressions are mainly used to externalize text. For example, to provide text in different languages by reading from a messages file.
@{...} - Link URL Expressions. Used to generate URLs, see the standard url syntax.
~{...} - Fragment Expression. Used to specify which fragment to include, see fragment
